## Overview

**The Living Garden** is an interactive, generative ecosystem where each visitor grows a unique **spirit** — a plant, animal, or cloud — born from their personality and choices.
All spirits coexist in a **shared, real-time garden**, rendered in **p5.js** and synchronized through **Socket.io**.

Built during the [NOVA Hackathon 2025](https://nova.scottylabs.org/).


## Features

* **Create your spirit** – answer poetic prompts to generate a personality and form
* **Shared world** — everyone’s spirits appear and move together via Socket.io
* **Persistent presence** — your spirit remains until reborn
